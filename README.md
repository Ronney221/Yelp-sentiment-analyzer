# Yelp Review Sentiment Analyzer

### Overview
The **Yelp Review Sentiment Analyzer** is a web-based application that fetches the most recent Yelp restaurant reviews and uses **IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding** to analyze sentiment, emotions, and key concepts from the reviews. Built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **RESTful APIs**, and front-end technologies like **HTML & CSS**, this project allows users to gain deeper insights into customer reviews, empowering them to make better dining choices.

## üåü Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses IBM Watson NLU to extract sentiment, emotions, and key concepts from unstructured Yelp reviews, delivering deep insights into customer feedback.
- **Yelp Fusion API Integration**: Retrieves real-time, up-to-date Yelp reviews for restaurants, providing users with the latest opinions and feedback on dining establishments.
- **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**: The application analyzes reviews to identify whether feedback is positive, negative, or neutral, while also recognizing emotions like joy, sadness, anger, and more.
- **Web Application**: Users input a Yelp URL, and the system retrieves and displays the reviews along with sentiment and emotion breakdowns, making it accessible from both web browsers and mobile devices.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Yelp Fusion API**: Provides the latest reviews and user-generated data for restaurants, ensuring real-time access to feedback.
- **IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding**: Performs sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and concept extraction using advanced AI and deep learning techniques.
- **Java**: The core backend language, known for its scalability and reliability.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the development of the backend and connects the RESTful APIs to the front-end web application.
- **HTML & CSS**: Ensures a user-friendly and visually appealing front-end design, with responsive elements for mobile compatibility.
- **RESTful APIs**: Facilitates seamless communication between the front-end and backend for efficient data retrieval.

## üîç How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users provide a Yelp restaurant URL, and the application processes the URL to extract relevant review data.
2. **Review Retrieval**: Using **Yelp Fusion API**, the system fetches three recent reviews for the specified restaurant.
3. **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**: IBM Watson's AI analyzes the reviews, detecting the sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and extracting key emotions (e.g., joy, anger, sadness).
4. **Concept Detection**: The app identifies key topics and concepts from the reviews, helping users better understand the overall themes discussed.
5. **Review Display**: The system presents the analyzed reviews, along with the sentiment score, emotions, and relevant concepts, to help users make informed dining decisions.

## üéØ Benefits

- **Sentiment-Aware Decision Making**: Empowers users to choose restaurants based on the real-time sentiment of recent reviews.
- **Emotion & Concept Extraction**: Provides deeper insights into the emotions expressed in reviews and the key topics discussed by customers.
- **Real-Time Data**: Ensures that the reviews are fresh and relevant by using the **Yelp API** to retrieve the most recent feedback.
- **Seamless Experience**: Built with **Java Spring Boot** and **RESTful APIs** to ensure efficient and scalable backend services, while the front-end offers a smooth and intuitive experience.

## üìà Why This Project Stands Out

- **Advanced NLP Integration**: Leverages IBM Watson's cutting-edge AI to deliver meaningful sentiment and emotional insights, going beyond traditional review systems.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Integrates a robust back-end (Java, Spring Boot) with a responsive front-end (HTML, CSS) to create a seamless and efficient user experience.
- **API Expertise**: Utilizes both **Yelp Fusion API** and **IBM Watson NLU API**, demonstrating strong skills in third-party API integration and data processing.
