# Yelp Review Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing the Yelp Reviews RESTful API to retrieve the three most recent restaurant reviews, including user names and timestamps. The gathered data is then subjected to comprehensive analysis using IBM Watson® Natural Language Understanding.

## Project Details

- **Data Retrieval**: The project involves connecting to the Yelp Reviews RESTful API to collect the latest restaurant reviews and associated user information.

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Leveraging IBM Watson® Natural Language Understanding, this project employs advanced deep learning techniques to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.

- **Text Analysis**: The analysis includes:
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment expressed in each review.
  - **Emotion Detection**: Identifying emotions conveyed within the text.
  - **Concept Extraction**: Extracting related concepts, categories, classification, entities, keywords, relations, and syntax mentioned within the reviews.

## Project Goal

The primary objective is to provide valuable insights to users based on the **sentiment**, **emotions**, and **key concepts** found in recent Yelp restaurant reviews. These insights can be invaluable for making informed decisions about dining choices.
